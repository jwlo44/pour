For my simple game idea I made a 3D game about watering flowers. 

How to Play
- WASD to move (alt. arrow keys)
- Space to jump
- E to water
- Mouse to look around 
- Tip: keep watering until you see the flower fully grown count go up! Particles will come out of the flower when it’s done growing.
Goal
- Water all the flowers
Features (rubric)
- Takes  user input
- Maintains state—counts how many flowers are left
- Winning Condition – all flowers watered
- Display game state – win screen, start screen, flower ui
Tests
- For each commit, I manually tested the new feature in my game. I found and fixed bugs such as the flowers wiggling too far by observing the output of my functions while the game was running.
- You can also see some of my debug statements from manual testing commented out
- Each method should have a comment describing what it does if the name is not sufficient
